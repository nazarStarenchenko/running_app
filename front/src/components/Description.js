        <span>Easy pace running.</span> Easy running pace (E pace), although typically in the range of only 65 to 79 percent HRmax, elicits desirable physiological benefits that build a solid base from which higher-intensity training can be performed. The heart muscle is strengthened, muscles receive increased blood supplies, and the working muscle cells increase their ability to process the oxygen. E pace runs make up the vast majority of a week's training schedule. Take up to 80% of your weekly milage. I suggest a minimum of 30 minutes for most E runs

        <span>Threshold training.</span> A threshold or tempo run is a specific workout wherein you run at and above your lactate threshold in order to improve your fitness. The overall aim for training and racing is for your heart rate to remain lower even at a faster pace as this means you can sustain this faster pace for longer. Two types of threshold training that I discuss in this chapter are tempo runs and cruise intervals. Tempo runs-steady, moderately prolonged runs-have been around for some time, but runners and coaches define them differently. Cruise intervals are a series of repeated runs with a brief recovery between runs. Threshold workouts need to be run at the proper intensity (speed). The proper pace for tempo runs and cruise intervals is the same â€” to 88 percent ofV02max, or 88 to 92 percent of vVOmax or maximum heart rate. Remember that the purpose of the workout is to stress lactate-clearance capability, not to overstress that capability. Ideally, a tempo run is nothing more than a steady 20-minute run at T pace. Subjectively, the intensity of effort associated with T-pace running is comfortably hard.

        <span>Interval training.</span> Intervals are used to train Stress aerobic power (V02max). Repeated runs of up to 5 min each with equal or less time of jog recoveries; up to 90-100% of your HRmax (the longer the distance, the smaller HR, but in those boundaries). Take distances from 400 meters to 1200 meters. To low like 100 m is for sprinting, so not for us, but two much will lead to fatigue and inability to perform later intervals efficiently. Consequently, I most often use mile and 1,200-meter intervals for men. The amount of recovery you should take between repeated runs in an interval ses sion should be equal to, or a little less than, the time spent performing the preceding workbout. The amount of quality running in an interval session should be up to 8 percent of weekly mileage, with a 6- mile or IO-kilometer maximum, or a 30-minute.

          <span>Repetition training </span>is the major type of training whose purpose is not aerobic. The benefits of R training are associated more with mechanics and anaerobic metabolism than with aerobic factors. In R training, you recruit the exact muscle fibers that you need for economical running. These are the muscle cells that allow you to run fast with minimal effort, minimal wasted movement, and minimal energy spent. Repetition workouts involve running at faster speeds, often at race pace or faster, while making sure that each workbout is done with proper technique and adequate recovery.
